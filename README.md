# C++ Login System

A simple **console-based user authentication system** built using C++. It supports **user registration, login, and password recovery**, with user data stored in a text file.

---

## Features

- User Registration (Name, Password, Email, Phone)
- User Login with credential verification
- Forgot Password functionality
- File-based data storage (`store.txt`)
- Clean, class-based modular code

---

## How It Works

User data is stored in the format:
- name*password*email*phone

On login or password recovery, the program scans the file line-by-line and matches credentials.

## File Structure
- ├── login.cpp # Source code
- ├── store.txt # User data file (auto-created)
- └── README.md # Project info
